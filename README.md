# MachineLearningProject

This project is focused on loading test data and training a machine learning model. It includes the following key features:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization and Problem Identification**: Visualizing data to identify patterns and potential issues.
- **Data Correction**: Correcting any identified issues in the data.
- **Multiple Training and Evaluation Scenarios**: Training the model using various scenarios and evaluating its performance.
- **Confusion Matrix Computation**: Computing the confusion matrix to assess the model's accuracy.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pavithra19/MachineLearningProject.git
   cd MachineLearningProject
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install "required_dependency_package"
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the data processing and model training:
```sh
python convert_data.py
```
